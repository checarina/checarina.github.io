        This dissertation explores language as a resource for the formation and expression of ethnic identity among the members of an Asian American college sorority. I argue that it is only through an understanding of the particular social context in which speakers exist that their linguistic behavior can be understood; conversely, examining linguistic behavior can illuminate how identity categories such as "Asian American" are construed and enacted within a given social setting.
