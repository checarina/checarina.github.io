        <h3>My story</h3>
    
        <p>
        I'm Carina, and I never thought I'd be a software developer.
        </p>
        <p>
        Flashback to the early 2000s: The World Wide Web was exciting and new. Geocities and Angelfire were flourishing. Strangers in chat rooms would ask you "a/s/l?" and no one used their real names or faces. As a nerdy teenager I began making webpages as a form of self-expression, sharing my writing, art, and passion for various boy bands. I dived into the world of free HTML and CSS tutorials, committing many crimes against W3C standards.
        </p>
        <p>
        Towards the end of that decade, I entered the PhD program in linguistics at New York University. As a sociolinguist, I studied how subtle (and not-so-subtle) variations in the way we speak reflect who we are as social beings. I primarily analyzed quantitative data using statistical methods such as ANOVA and linear regression. I also managed to land a gig as the department webmaster, largely because I knew what an &lt;h1&gt; tag is.
        </p>
        <p>
        After graduating, I spent a few years running around the New York City Metropolitan Area, eking out a living as an adjunct professor, sending out countless CVs and research statements whenever a position opened up in Kansas or Australia, and racking up financial and emotional debt that continues to accumulate interest.
        </p>
        <p>
        Which brings us back to the present: In 2022, I became a student at <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developers Academy</a> in Seattle and officially promoted my long-time hobby to a full-time occupation. If my adolescent self could see me now, would she be surprised? Perhaps not. She'd probably be sad about Geocities, though.

        <h3>Trivia</h3>

          My other passions include books, cats, and crossword puzzles.
